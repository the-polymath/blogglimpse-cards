    excerpt: 'Learn the fundamentals of web development and start your journey as a developer.',
    content: `Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're interested in frontend, backend, or full-stack development, there are many paths you can take to begin your journey.

Starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is the traditional route many developers take. These three technologies form the foundation of web development and are essential skills for any web developer.

As you progress, you'll want to learn frameworks and libraries that make development more efficient. React, Vue, and Angular are popular choices for frontend development, while Node.js, Python, and Ruby are common backend technologies.

Remember that becoming a web developer is a journey, not a destination. Keep learning, stay curious, and don't be afraid to experiment with new technologies.`,
